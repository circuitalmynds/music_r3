00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:02.879
(TV buzzing)

00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:08.020
- Now what is rap music?

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.051
Well, in a sense we cannot
use that particular item

00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:15.221
because "what" has
nothing to do with music.

00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:17.712
"What" is a unit of measure

00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:20.352 position:61%
used to determine the necessary current

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:22.663
to excite an incandescent lab

00:00:22.663 --> 00:00:24.732
to its proper candle power.

00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:29.533
Many people thought that rap
began in Hollywood one day

00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.366
when a child was born.

00:00:32.527 --> 00:00:35.244 position:59%
And they called it the Andrew Sisters.

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:38.388
It was a child of a Bayou woman.

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:39.305
Not by you.

00:00:40.738 --> 00:00:41.975
A Bayou woman,

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.807 position:56%
who with her beautiful diamond rings

00:00:44.807 --> 00:00:46.724
and her store bought hair.

00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:48.904 position:58%
This is the development where we find

00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:50.586
that in the bassoon section,

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:52.815
we find categorically to accept

00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:54.256
a nondiploom or an entity

00:00:54.256 --> 00:00:58.323
where we find that it is
written in fugital form.

00:00:58.323 --> 00:00:59.610
Now, what is a fuge?

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.298
A fuge is like rap,

00:01:01.298 --> 00:01:04.007
only if fuge starts where

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:07.339
in its contrapuntal form
where we find that the

00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:09.538
melody keeps coming in

00:01:09.538 --> 00:01:12.438
